# wells-and-gradients

## The Premise
1. Two 2D Perlin noise maps. One represents the water density; the other represents the population density.
2. Given a limited amount of wells, find a solution where the wells provide the water to the most people.
## End Goal A
The range of the wells is dependent on the location of placement. Efficiency is measured by the amount of people in range.
## End Goal B
The range of the wells is fixed. Efficiency is measured by the amount of water per person.
